                        <h1>Reading <3 </h1>
                        <p>I love books because they offer a gateway to new worlds, ideas, and emotions, allowing me to escape and reflect. I find a special connection with Japanese literature, which often weaves together elements of the surreal and the everyday in a way that deeply resonates with me. Haruki Murakami is my favorite author; his storytelling has a unique blend of mystery, introspection, and magical realism that I find captivating. His works always leave me thinking about life from a different perspective.</p>

                        <h1>Media</h1>
                        <p>I’m a huge fan of movies and TV series, and two of my all-time favorites are the Star Wars series and Breaking Bad. Star Wars captivates me with its epic storytelling, memorable characters, and the vast universe it creates—there’s always something new to discover in that galaxy far, far away. On the other hand, Breaking Bad stands out for its intense character development and gripping narrative. The way it explores moral dilemmas and the transformation of Walter White makes it one of the most compelling shows I’ve ever watched.</p>

It gives me a sense of accomplishment and boosts my energy levels, helping me stay focused and productive throughout the day. Beyond the physical benefits, working out is also a great way to relieve stress and clear my mind. It’s a time where I can challenge myself, push my limits, and improve both my health and well-being.</p>

It’s a great way to build lasting friendships and expand my understanding of the world. In university, networking is especially valuable as it opens doors to opportunities, whether it's collaborating on projects, learning from others' experiences, or even setting the foundation for future professional connections. Being social in these environments helps me grow both personally and academically.</p>

It’s incredibly satisfying to build something from scratch and see it work as intended. The constant learning and problem-solving keep me engaged and motivated.

                One thing about me is the fact that I always find myself invested in way too many hobbies. Way more than my schedule can handle. However, I do not think of it as a bad thing. Ot helps me discover myself as a person, thereby understanding what I like, and what I do not. Though out the years I've picked up quite many but the ones I am most excited about are listed at the top.
