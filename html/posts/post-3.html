            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My programming journey started back in the 8th grade, when I first encountered C#. At the time, I was still figuring things out, but that initial experience sparked something in me. Over the years, I’ve developed multiple projects and gradually expanded my skill set. I’ve worked with a variety of technologies, including C# (ASP.NET), JavaScript, SQL, Haskell, HTML, and CSS. Each new language and framework has given me a deeper understanding of how to approach problems from different angles.</p>
                
                <p>What I love most about programming is the sense of accomplishment that comes from turning ideas into fully functional solutions. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work on a variety of projects that have challenged me to apply my skills in new and creative ways. After graduating from an online university (Softuni), I developed a range of applications, including a banking app, a platform for learning and creating skills, and even an interactive Christmas game. </p>
