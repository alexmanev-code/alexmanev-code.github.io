                <div class="Strengths">
                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <p>I see myself as having good planning skills as well as clever time-management that assists my schedule. Because I can plan well, I am able to distribute my work in a way that makes me ahead of the given deadline, leaving room for adjustments and corrections. Additionally, I see myself as a great group leader, due to my assessment skills, I am able to determine the strengths of my colleagues and also motivate them into joining together to make something significant.</p>

                <div class="Weaknesses">
                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>A pitfall of mine is that I let people take advantage of my efforts and therefore receive result on my behalf.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Opportunities">
                    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>The opportunities that I foresee are the connections with people I can make. Networking is a big step to success and is undoubtedly useful in numerous occasions. Another opportunity is the academic certificates and projects that build a portfolio, which is really important when presenting yourself to companies and institutions.   </p>
                </div>
                <div class="Threats">
                    <h3>Threats</h3>
                    <p>A possible treat I imagine is balancing social and professional life. Having to balance social events and daily tasks with education is a major challenge but with the right mindset and planning skills it could be dealt with.</p>
