            <div class="content">
<p>My first feedback focused on two key areas: the font and the overall layout of the site. I was advised to change the font, as Comic Sans wasn't well-received, and to pick a consistent layout to improve the site's structure and appearance. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the feedback, as I didn’t see much issue with my original choices. However, after some reflection, I started to understand the importance of making the site look more professional. I decided to switch to a more suitable, professional font and chose a cohesive color palette that aligned with the site’s theme, ensuring a polished and focused design.</p>
