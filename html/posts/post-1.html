                <h4>Passion in my study choice</h4>
                <p>I chose ICT as my study because I've never envisioned myself as anything other than a developer. Ever since I was little, I’ve been captivated by technology and how it continues to shape the world around us. I’ve always been the kind of person who wanted to understand how things work and how to build something from scratch. The possibilities that come with creating innovative solutions, developing software, and working with the latest technologies like AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing inspire me to push my own limits.</p>
                <h4>Creativity of the field</h4>
                <p>What excites me most about the ICT field is its limitless potential. Whether it’s developing a new app, brainstorming cutting-edge solutions for businesses, or being part of a team that brings ideas to life, the opportunities to make a tangible impact are endless. This program offers exactly what I’ve been looking for—a perfect blend of technology, creativity, and teamwork. It’s the ideal environment for me to refine my skills, learn the latest trends, and ultimately build a career doing something I’ve always been passionate about: creating and innovating through technology.</p>
