                <h2>What is my motivation?</h2>
                <p>My motivation for programming stems from a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and creativity. I’ve always been fascinated by how code can transform abstract ideas into functional, interactive solutions. When I first encountered programming in 8th grade with C#, it was like discovering a new way to express myself. The challenge of breaking down complex problems and building something from scratch was both exhilarating and rewarding. Over time, as I worked on personal projects and delved into new languages like JavaScript, I realized that programming not only satisfies my curiosity but also aligns with my desire to create and innovate. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me constantly engaged and excited about the endless possibilities for learning and growth.</p>

                <h2>What pushed me towards ICT?</h2>
                <p>I chose the ICT program because I’m excited by how technology connects and transforms our world. From AI to cloud solutions and cybersecurity, the field’s endless possibilities align with my passion for innovation and problem-solving. The program’s focus on technology, creativity, and teamwork offers the perfect environment for me to explore and develop these interests.</p>
