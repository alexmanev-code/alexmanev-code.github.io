            <p>Upon completing the program, I envision myself pursuing a career as a software engineer, which is a role that deeply intrigues me due to the blend of creativity/ problem-solving, that allows you to make an impact on the world. 
                
                In the future, having finished my studies, I hope to have gained a solid foundation in my computer science abilities. The technical skills aside, I want to know how to approach complex problems critically, think logically under pressure and most importantly collaborate effectively in diverse teams. 
                
                Ultimately, my motivation stems from a desire to be a part of this rapidly evolving field that has potential to shape the future. I hope that by the end of the program I will not only be well-equipped with the technical expertise, but also have a clear understanding of how I can contribute to society.</p>

                <p>A hobby of mine that I would love to talk about is reading books.</p>
                    
                <p>Due to my area of interest I tend to spend a lot of time in front of a screen, that is why in my free time, when I am not indulged in the digital world, I treat myself to some light reading.</p>
                    
                <p>For me picking a book is one the most unique experiences, because every book has a different story to tell and a different way to present it. Books are a universal tool for gathering information not only on academical subjects, but also on life itself. Every title I have read has introduced me to new ways of thinking and has really given me an opportunity to reflect on life. The work of an author is like a portal to their soul. Entering it reveals a whole new mindset, full of unique decisions and thoughts.</p>
                    
                <p>For me reading is a hobby that allows me to enrichen my mind with stories, thoughts and different world views, that change the perspective on my own individual life. Due to there being tons of authors and even more books, I am never bored when immersing myself into a new literature work.</p>
