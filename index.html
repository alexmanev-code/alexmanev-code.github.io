                <h2>What is my motivation?</h2>
                <p>My motivation for programming stems from a deep-seated passion for problem-solving and creativity. I’ve always been fascinated by how code can transform abstract ideas into functional, interactive solutions. When I first encountered programming in 8th grade with C#, it was like discovering a new way to express myself. The challenge of breaking down complex problems and building something from scratch was both exhilarating and rewarding. Over time, as I worked on personal projects and delved into new languages like JavaScript, I realized that programming not only satisfies my curiosity but also aligns with my desire to create and innovate. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me constantly engaged and excited about the endless possibilities for learning and growth.</p>
