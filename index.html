                    My place in the IT world
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My place in the IT world began when I was first introduced to programming in the 8th grade. C# was my first coding language, and while I didn't excel at it right away, something about it intrigued me. Over time, as I started working on personal projects, my skills improved, and I began to understand the nuances of coding. What started as a challenging subject eventually became a passion, and each new project fueled my interest even further.

                   Fit for ICT?

                <p>
                    I believe I'm a good fit for the ICT world because I genuinely enjoy creating things and have a real drive to solve problems. Starting out with programming through personal projects helped me pick up skills quickly, and I love how the field pushes me to keep learning and thinking outside the box.                </p>

                            <p>Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in Visual Studio, but I now lean towards VS Code for its flexibility and streamlined experience, making it my go-to IDE.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to programming languages, C# will always be a favorite of mine since it was the first language I learned and the one that sparked my interest in coding. That said, I'm currently exploring JavaScript, and it’s starting to grow on me. With its versatility and wide range of uses, I think it could eventually replace C# as my number one language.</p>
